### User Scopes

Optional scopes are to be granted from every user onboarded on Axolo. They allow us to reduce notifications when the engineer does an action in GitHub.

| User Scope      | Reason                                                                   |

| channels:write  | Manage a user‚Äôs public channels and create new ones on a user‚Äôs behalf   |
| groups:write    | Manage private channels that Axolo has been added to and create new ones |
| reactions:write | Add and edit emoji reactions                                             |

## GitHub installation (and scopes)

When the Slack application is installed, you will need to install our GitHub or GitLab application.

You need to choose between installing Axolo on all of your organization repositories or selecting only specific repositories. You will be able to add new repositories along the way if you choose the latter.

![](/images/Github+installation-1.png)

<Warning>
  Axolo does not have access to your company‚Äôs code. GitHub code lies in the
  ‚ÄúContent API‚Äù. More information about GitHub scopes can be [found
  here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/permissions-required-for-github-apps#about-github-app-permissions)
</Warning>

## GitLab Cloud installation (and scopes)

If your team is on GitLab, the installation is very similar to GitHub but less granular.

After installing the application, you will need to select the GitLab group you want to integrate with Axolo. Then, Axolo will save your organization members and project information.

### Required GitLab scopes

|  scope  |                                   description                                    |

| openid  |                        Authenticate using OpenID Connect                         |
| profile | Allows read-only access to the user's personal information using OpenID Connect  |
|  email  | Allows read-only access to the user's primary email address using OpenID Connect |

## Axolo onboarding

### Onboard your team

Now that Slack and GitHub/GitLab applications are configured, we only need to match GitHub/GitLab members to Slack users.

_You can filter your team members by specific GitHub/GitLab teams, or search their logins._

![](/images/select-members-1.png)

### Create a team channel

The final step is to establish your first team channel. Team channels keep your team informed of new pull requests in a specific Slack channel and automatically sync PR Status, Reviewers, Assignees. It will show with an emoji what is the reviewer current state (ie: üëç approved, üí¨ comments).

![](/images/realtime-1.webp)

If you're a new Axolo user, we suggest starting with the default \_axolo channel settings. You can always fine-tune your team channels later on.

üéâ Congratulations! You can start using Axolo. You can directly create PR channels for open pull requests, or go to your organization settings to personalize your Axolo experience.

We recommend you read our [Make the best of Axolo guide](/getting-started/best-of-axolo) to getting started.
